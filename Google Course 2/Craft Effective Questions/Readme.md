Great work reinforcing your learning with a thoughtful self-reflection! A good reflection on this topic would describe how you applied SMART questions to the scenario.

Here are a few questions you might want to ask:

When is the project due?

Are there any specific challenges to keep in mind? 

Who are the major stakeholders for this project, and what do they expect this project to do for them?

Who am I presenting the results to?

Here are some examples of questions you might ask based on the suggested topics:

Objectives: What are the goals of the deep dive? What, if any, questions are expected to be answered by this deep dive?

Audience: Who are the stakeholders? Who is interested or concerned about the results of this deep dive? Who is the audience for the presentation?

Time: What is the time frame for completion? By what date does this need to be done?

Resources: What resources are available to accomplish the deep dive's goals?

Security: Who should have access to the information?

These questions can help you focus on techniques and analyses that produce results of interest to stakeholders. They also clarify the deliverable’s due date, which is important to know so you can manage your time effectively. When you start work on a project, you need to ask questions that align with the plan and the goals and help you explore the data. The more questions you ask, the more you learn about your data, and the more powerful your insights will be.

Asking thorough and specific questions means clarifying details until you get to concrete requirements. With clear requirements and goals, it’s much easier to plan and execute a successful data analysis project and avoid time-consuming problems down the road.
